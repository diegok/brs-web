          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Founded in 2010, Barcelona Rainbow Singers is the four-voice mixed LGBT choir in Barcelona and the first LGBTIQ+ choir on the country.</p>
          <p>At the moment we are around 50 singers of different ages, backgrounds and sex-affective choices that form an independent, inclusive and non-profit association open to everyone who loves music and wants to sing in an atmosphere of joy, respect and companionship.</p>
          <p>Through music, we are committed to the visibility of diversity and we contribute our grain of sand to build a society where no one is despised or discriminated against for being the way they are.</p>
          <p>As we get together to rehearse and put on our shows, we put into practice the model of equality, respect and integration that we want for society. Thus, we intend to carry our message to all audiences.</p>

          <h2>What do we do?</h2>
          <p>Every year we prepare a thematic repertoire of trilingual contemporary music (Catalan, Spanish, English) framed in a show that takes place at the end of the cycle, in which we try to convey our view of the world and society, celebrating respect, integration and diversity in all its forms.</p>
          <p>We enrich our vocal performance with the participation of local musicians, choreography, stage work, costumes and set design.</p>
          <p>Every year we make between 6 and 10 presentations at different events, many of them supporting some cause of the lgbtiq + collective; taking our show to Civic and Cultural Centers, theaters, events of official entities, corporate events, churches and the same street.</p>
          <p>The 2017-2018 cycle is dedicated to the adventure of self-discovery, the celebration of love and overcoming adversity, presenting "Rainbow Histories del Cor" at the Teatre Del Eixample, directed by Oliver Carrasco.</p>
          <p>During the 2018-2019 cycle, directed by Manel Ferr√©, we dedicated our repertoire to love and overcoming heartbreak and presented the show "Show Must Go On" at the Espai Fontana de Gracia.</p>
          <p>The 2019-2020 cycle, with the same director, we are dedicating to the celebration of our tenth anniversary, reviewing our repertoire and our history.</p>
